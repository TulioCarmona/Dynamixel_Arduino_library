# Dynamixel_Arduino_library
The next repository is a library to use Dynamixel motors with arduino without using their proprietary hardware. 
Currentrly support only for Protocol 1.0 and works with physical serial ports of arduino. (Working on SoftwareSerial compatibility).
Description will be added later. However commands work similar to matlab tools for dynamixel.

To use this library with your respective Dynamixel motor check to the [official site](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/) and look for the specifications. Specifically look for the Control Table of the motor in which it is specified the addres of comands and ther byte size.
