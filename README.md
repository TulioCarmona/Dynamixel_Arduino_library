# Dynamixel_Arduino_library
The next repository is a library to use Dynamixel motors with arduino without using their proprietary hardware. 
Currentrly support only for Protocol 1.0 and works with physical serial ports of arduino. (Working on SoftwareSerial compatibility).
Description will be added later. However commands work similar to matlab tools for dynamixel.
